# About
This project is to learn cross-compile on x86_64 and arm_raspberry, using  
Makefile and script to build and configure.  
# How to use ?
- Run "tree" cmd  
- Run ./configure first to choose the toolchain, otherwise, it will   
  defaultly choose x86_64 arch  
- "make" for x86_64 or "make rspi3" if you want to build for rasberry pi3  
- Remember to make clean after you change the toolchain architecture  
# Hope you like this.
